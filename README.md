What are microservices?
Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

Highly maintainable and testable
Loosely coupled
Independently deployable
Organized around business capabilities
Owned by a small team
The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

OR we can say that 
Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a distinctive method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations. The trend has grown popular in recent years as Enterprises look to become more Agile and move towards a DevOps and continuous testing. 

What is Monolithic Architecture?
Traditionally, applications were built on a monolithic architecture, a model in which all modules in an application are interconnected in a single, self-contained unit. All code exists inside a single codebase, which means that the entire application is deployed at the same time, and scaling is achieved by adding additional nodes.

The problem with monoliths isn’t so much that there’s an inherent problem with the architecture. In fact, simple applications with limited feature sets may benefit from this approach. The challenge comes when companies grow their applications–adding features and bug fixes on top of everything that came before.


What are Microservices?
Microservices are designed to combat the problems associated with monoliths by going in the complete opposite direction. Microservices are an architectural style where an application is broken into a series of modules, each associated with a specific business objective.
